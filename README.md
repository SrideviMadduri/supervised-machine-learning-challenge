# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
In this challenge created a  machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically,  will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Retrieve the data

Imported the lending data lending_data.csv from the Resources folder using Pandas.


## Prediction
The Logistic regression will perform better than the Random forest classifier for this dataset. Because the logistic regression predicts a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables, in this case the target - loan status being 0 and 1.


## Consider the models
Created and compared two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forest classifier.Then analysed the scores across the models and here is the final results.


## Conclusion:

Logestic Regression:
Training Data Score: 0.9921240885954051
Testing Data Score: 0.9918489475856377

Random Forest Classifier :
Training Score: 0.9975409272252029
Testing Score: 0.9917457697069748


logistic model performed a little better based on the score  compared to the Random forest classifier. This result shows my prediction was right.
